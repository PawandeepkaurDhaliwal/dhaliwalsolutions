1. **Operational risk**: My company can face operational risk because during daily tasks some problems are occur such as system failure, employee errors etc. Due to this, day to day operations are effected and some delayed can possible. Consequently, extend the budget and time period of project.
2.  **Quality risk:** This is major risk for my company .Due to this risk my company can not
   achieve its targets because success of my business is based on quality of products. If my
   company will not provide quality things to customers then customers will not accept my product
   which will be not good for my company’s reputation and my business will drop. We will also
   have to work on maintenance of software which my company will sell but if my employees will
   not be giving quality work then customer satisfaction will be effected. As a result, my company
   can not achieve success in future.
3.  **Security threat:** Most of the technical companies face this problem. Data leakage is major
   threat in all the tech companies nowadays. My company will also face a threat from cyber crime
   such as hackers may hack the personal information of organisation as well as customers, data
   stealing or create a duplicate products. Due to this my venture can loss its uniqueness of services
   as well as reputation in market.
4.  **Economic risk**: Due to the advancement in technology sometimes company can not adopt
   latest technology or delay for that. Due to this, cost of making software can be increased and sale
   can be reduced .Hence, my organisation will face financial risk. Another reason can be
   sometimes investors will not invest the amount for my organisation then my firm will face
   economic risk.
5. **Team risk:** Employees are major part for any business. So, skilled workers are first demand
   of my company.so, if employees can not adopt new technology then my company can not fulfill
   customers demands as well as my company have to hire new employees or need to give training
   to them. This process will be expensive for my business. And if I hire any new employees for my
   business then it will be difficult for old employees to coordinate with the new employee’s easily
   which will effect the productivity of my business.
